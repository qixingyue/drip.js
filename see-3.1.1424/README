Welcome to SEE (Simple ECMAScript Engine).

SEE is a library that provides an ECMAScript (JavaScript) run-time
environment.

Running configure and compiling in the normal way should provide
the library 'libsee.a' and a test application, 'see-shell'.  I
strongly recommend that you have Boehm-gc installed (it's a garbage
collector library) otherwise see-shell just uses the non-free'ing
malloc().  Run configure with the '--help' argument to see switches
on how to configure it for boehm-gc.

Documentation for development using the SEE library can be found in
doc/USAGE.html.  The 'see-shell' program doubles as an example and
demonstration of how the library is intended to be used.

I hope you find this library useful. Please send bug reports back to me
via <leonard@users.sourceforge.net>. New releases of SEE will be announced
at <http://freshmeat.net/projects/see/> and made available at
<http://www.adaptive-enterprises.com.au/~d/software/see/>.

The subversion repository for SEE is available at 
svn://svn.adaptive-enterprises.com.au/repos/see/
