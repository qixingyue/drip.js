ssp - SEE servlet pages

This is a demonstration of using SEE in a simple web server to serve
pages with embedded JavaScript. Compare this with JSP, PHP and ASP.

The interpreter starts off with the standard ECMAscript environment
plus the following:

	print(str)	- prints a string to the request output
	include(path)	- recursively includes another ssp file
	REQUEST_METHOD	- the HTTP request method (eg "GET")
	QUERY_STRING	- the part of the URI after the '?', or ""
	QUERY_URI	- the URI requested

If the QUERY_STRING is "raw", then the raw javascript to be
executed is shown.

The modules in this directory are:
        httpd.c         - process HTTP request and invoke ssp in own thread
        pool.c          - memory pool allocator, as alternative to a GC
        ssp.c           - loads a file and executes code within <%...%>

Run the server (httpd) from this source directory, it listens on port 8000.
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/test.ssp with your web browser. You should
see the file in your browser with the <%..%> embedded parts evaluated.
